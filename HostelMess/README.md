The application effectively manages the mess halls. The system allows users to access 
and mark their attendance through this app. It also enables customers to select dishes from the 
available menu of the day. The menu will be decided on the choice of the Student. The Student 
will mark their choice of dishes for upcoming days and the mess manager or admin will provide 
the dish based on the student selection. The app has the functionality which allow user to mark 
attendance and select the menu prior of the opening time of mess. By taking the attendance 
there will be less wastage of food and the mess managers can manage the mess in a better way 
with the staff. The app also gives the notification to the user for attendance. 
The app also has different features for both students and managers. The manager will 
be the admin of the app and have access to set today’s menu and see today’s attendance i.e. the 
number of students who are coming to mess. The managers also have the functionality to set 
future menu for upcoming days. Student can give feedback on menu and can also raise 
complaint. Admin can handle feedbacks and complaints. We believe that the technology can 
give this type of facility effectively and helps to reduce food wastage.

The Existing system is not completely computerized. There is no facility to see the 
menu and then mark their attendance according to their choice. Student cannot give feedback 
and register complain regarding food. There is food wastage if student is not present. Current 
system is not user friendly and it is manual. Admin cannot keep track of expenses and number 
of students enrolled in mess. Student feedback can help mess manager to improve quality of 
food and service. In existing system student cannot select menu prior.

The main aim of any mess is to provide clean and fresh food to the students of the 
college. In many messes, there is no facility to see the menu and then mark their attendance 
according to their choice. Here we are providing features of mark attendance and also to see 
today’s menu. It would be possible to reduce the food wastage in mess by marking attendance 
and without using much efforts and manpower if, there existed a software for the same. Thus, 
there arises a need to create an app for the same. Such software would make the entire Mess 
related management an automated system. The app is not only restricted to food attendance 
and see future menu but also have feature to give feedback and raise complaints.
